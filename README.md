# ETH Price Forecasting with LSTM

This project fetches historical Ethereum (ETH/USDT) daily price data from Binance using CCXT and performs time-series forecasting with an LSTM neural network. It includes data preprocessing, monthly and daily price analysis with interactive Plotly visualizations, LSTM model training, evaluation using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R² metrics, and predicts the next 15 days of ETH closing prices. The notebook provides a complete pipeline from data collection to future price prediction and visualization.
